# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains all the machine learning projects completed by me. I have explicitly mentioned the models, algorithms used for all the mini-projects and advanced projects, so that anyone, who wishes to use it can have a better idea about how the problem statement can be dealt with.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out my website

*(All .ipynb and .py files and datasets can be downloaded further and used by interested individuals for fair use. Some datasets are provided with link to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com))* and some datasets are loaded using [sklearn.datasets()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets)

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning (using Python from scratch)

  The projects in this section are built without using Scikit-learn's inbuilt ML Models. Tools used in these projects are mainly : Numpy and Pandas. Matplotlib has been used, wherever visualizations were required.

- ### Machine Learning (using Scikit-learn)

  	- [E-commerce Customers](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Ecommerce%20Customers) (Linear Regression): Using Ecommerce customers datset, provided by a comapny, recommend them whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website for maximizing profit.
	- [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction) (Logistic Regression): working with the Titanic data set from Kaggle and predict a classification - survival or deceased for any onboard passenger.
	- [Advertisement clicked or not?](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Ad%20Clicked%20or%20not) (Logistic Regression): Based on user data provided, predict whether he/she clicked on an ad or not.
