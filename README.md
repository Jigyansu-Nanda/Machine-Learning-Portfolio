# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains all the machine learning projects completed by me. I have explicitly mentioned the models, algorithms used for all the mini-projects and advanced projects, so that anyone, who wishes to use it can have a better idea about how the problem statement can be dealt with.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out my website

*(All .ipynb and .py files and datasets can be downloaded further and used by interested individuals for fair use. Some datasets are provided with link to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)* and some datasets are loaded using [sklearn.datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets))

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning (using Python from scratch)

  The projects in this section are built **without** using Scikit-learn's inbuilt ML Models. Tools used in these projects are mainly : Numpy and Pandas. Matplotlib has been used, wherever visualizations were required.
  	- [Deciding number of Components in PCA ](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20(using%20Python%20from%20scratch)/Deciding%20number%20of%20Components%20in%20PCA/PCA_components.ipynb) : A statistical approach to decide number of Components in Principal Component Analysis, using Explained-Variance.
	- [Logistic Regression ](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20(using%20Python%20from%20scratch)/Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb) : Logistic regression on created fake dataset using Numpy

- ### ML (micro Projects) (using Scikit-learn)

  	- [E-commerce Customers](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Ecommerce%20Customers) (Linear Regression): Using Ecommerce customers datset, provided by a comapny, recommend them whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website for maximizing profit.
	- [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Titanic%20Survival%20Prediction) (Logistic Regression): working with the Titanic data set from Kaggle and predict a classification - survival or deceased for any onboard passenger.
	- [Advertisement clicked or not?](https://github.com/Jigyansu-Nanda/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20(Micro%20Projects)/Ad%20Clicked%20or%20not) (Logistic Regression): Based on user data provided, predict whether he/she clicked on an ad or not.
