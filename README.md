# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains all the machine learning projects completed by me. I have explicitly mentioned the models, algorithms used for all the micro-projects and slightly advanced projects, so that anyone, who wishes to use it can have a better idea about how the problem statement can be dealt with.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out my website

*(All .ipynb and .py files and datasets can be downloaded further and used by intersted individuals for fair use. Some datasets are provided with link to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com))*
